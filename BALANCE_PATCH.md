To suggest a balance or game design change change do the following:

1. Open a pull request with your changes in the hc-tcg repo with the title `[Balance Request] <your change>`.
    Please follow this template for your pull request:
    ```
    <!-- Please ensure CI passes. Adjust starter decks as neccesary to ensure they are valid after your changes. -->

    ### Description:
    <!-- Provide a description of the change and the reason for suggesting it. This is meant to be used in the patchnotes. -->

    ### Sponsors:
    <!-- The Discord usernames of three community members who want to sponsor this change. Please provide as a list like A, B, C. -->
    ```

    Make sure to properly fill out all these fields with the most best information you can.

2. After your pull request is made, and passes CI, a poll will be opened.
If over half of all community members vote in favor of the change it will be merged and available in the next patch.

3. After two weeks, there will be another poll.
If more than half of the community members vote to revert the change, it will be reverted.
